XML Schema Parser
==============================================

This is supposed to be a minimal porting from [Apache XmlSchema](https://ws.apache.org/xmlschema/)
to TypeScript for what is required for the Data Mapper with using [fast-xml-parser](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser#readme).
The main focus is to parse the XML schema file and build a Data Mapper Document model.

Always honor the upstream for the internal design so we can share the common sense.
